## WRFDA Tutorial

This repository is a collaboration between [William Hatheway](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhatheway/) and [Jeremy Benik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-benik/). In this repository, we will outline the steps necessary to run WRFDA using real data for real-world applications.

This repository will contain the necessary information to run WRFDA using bufr data (prepbufr, satwnd.bufr, etc.) as well as information on running WRFDA with observation data. 

Due to the complexity of converting observation data into little r ascii format, we may not include codes for that since there are many different types of observations that can go into little r format and we cannot obtain nor convert them all. 

For any errors or bugs, please create an issue and tag one of us in it so we can attend to it. 

Please note, this is done through volunteer work to help the community have better access to WRFDA. This will take a lot of work as well as a lot of time. If you submit an issue, it may be a while before one of us can attend to it.
